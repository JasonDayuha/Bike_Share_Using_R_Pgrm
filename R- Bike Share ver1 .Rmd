# 1. Introduction

This is a capstone project from Google’s Data Analyst curriculum program.  A bike share program in Chicago would like to increase its future success which depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships in its program. The company has provided data to be analyzed to  aid with the marketing team in finding strategies to convert casual riders to annual members.

# 2. Ask Guided Questions

2.1 Characters and teams:

* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.

* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. 

* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

2.2 Business task:

* Lily Mareno the director of marketing has assigned the question, "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"



2.3 Data:

* The data to be analyzed has been sourced from: Index of bucket "divvy-tripdata": [ Data set](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data is available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is public data for the purpose of exploring how diﬀerent customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. Regarding data-privacy issues, the historical purchases using personal payment information and fare rate are not provided.

# 3. Preparing Data for Exploration
The last 12 months of data ( November 2021 - October 2022 ) will be analyzed for the purpose of this project. Data comes in 12 cvs files for corresponding to the last 12 months. All 12 files take a lot of memory to handle so R programming will be use to complete this project. Regarding the quality of this data, it is considered data that has been generated by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC (“Bikeshare”) that operates in the City of Chicago’s (“City”) Divvy bicycle sharing service.

#We start working with the data by first combining the last 12 months of data into one file. Then check the data for a quick overview of whats in the data frame.


# Combine all 12 data file into one data set
bike_rides <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7,df8,df9,df10,df11,df12)

# produce an overview of the data
str(bike_rides)

skim_without_charts(bike_rides)

glimpse(bike_rides)

```
### Cleaning Data

4.3 Clean up column names for proper formatting 

```{r clean_column, eval=FALSE}

# 4.3 make all column names text with proper formatting
clean_names(bike_rides)


# check if columns with dates are formatted as dates
sapply(bike_rides, is.po) 


# results shows that all columns formatted as dates are true 

```

4.4 To aide in future analysis create new columns for year, month , day , week ,  y/m/d , and  h:m:s by adding extra columns to the data set. The codes used were created with the help of Isabel Peels project as [referance](https://isabellapeel.github.io/Cyclistic_Case_Study-Divvy_Bikes/Analysis_w_code.html#statistic-summary) .

```{r new_columns,eval=FALSE}


# 4.4 Create column data for year, month , day , week ,  y/m/d , & h:m:s  . 
bike_rides$year <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at, 
  "%Y"
)

# Month 
bike_rides$month <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at, 
  "%m"
)


  # Week 
bike_rides$week <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at,
  "%W"
)

# Day
bike_rides$day <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at, 
  "%d"
)

# Day of week 
bike_rides$day_of_week <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at, 
  "%A"
)

# Date, YYYY-MM-DD
bike_rides$YMD <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at, 
  "%Y-%m-%d"
)

# Time of Day, HH:MM:SS
bike_rides$ToD <- format(
  bike_rides$started_at, 
  "%H:%M:%S"
)

```
4.5 Check to make sure all numbers are formatted correctly.

```{r number_format_check, eval=FALSE}
# 4.5 the following checks all columns if numeric:
sapply(bike_rides ,is.numeric)

# Order by date 
bike_rides <- bike_rides %>%
  arrange(started_at)
```

4.6 Find the ride length and create a new column in the data set. Delete any rows with ride_length less than zero because anything else does not make sense. 
```{r ride_length,eval=FALSE}

# 4.6 Find the ride length and create a new column in the data frame.Delete any rows with ride_length less then zero because anything else does not make sense. 
bike_rides$ride_length <- difftime(
  bike_rides$ended_at, 
  bike_rides$started_at,
  units = "secs"
) 

glimpse(bike_rides)
# By checking the data with glimpse, it looks like the ride length is time base, change to numeric for ease of analysis
#ride length is less then zero, which is cause for deletion
bike_rides$ride_length <- as.numeric(
  as.character(bike_rides$ride_length))

# to keep original data, we create a new cleaned data set named "bike_rides_cleaned".
bike_rides_cleaned <- bike_rides %>%
  filter(!(ride_length < 0))

check1 <- bike_rides_cleaned %>%
  arrange(ride_length)
```



4.7 Delete any rows with NA and "test" data.
```{r NA_test_deletetion, eval=FALSE}

# 4.7 Delete any rows with NA 
bike_rides_cleaned <- na.omit(bike_rides_cleaned)


#There are some station names which are capitalized. Identify the station and delete that particular bike ride data since it represents test data. 

capitalized_station_name_check <- bike_rides_cleaned %>%
  
  filter(
    str_detect(start_station_name, "[:upper:]")
    & !str_detect(start_station_name,"[:lower:]")
  ) %>%
  
  group_by(
    start_station_name
  ) %>%
  
  count(
    start_station_name
  )

# Remove capitalized station name
bike_rides_cleaned <- bike_rides_cleaned %>%
  filter(
    !(str_detect(start_station_name, "[:upper:]")
      & !str_detect(start_station_name, "[:lower:]"))
  )

```

# 5. Analyses


```{r stat_summery, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

# Statistical Summery

SELECT 
    member_casual,
    COUNT(*) as total_trips,
    AVG(ride_length_min) as avg_ride_length_mins,
    SUM(ride_length_min) / 60 as total_bike_ride_length_hr,
    SUM(CASE WHEN rideable_type = 'electric_bike' THEN ride_length_min ELSE 0 END) / 60 as total_electric_bike_ride_length_hr,
    SUM(CASE WHEN rideable_type = 'docked_bike' THEN ride_length_min ELSE 0 END) / 60 as total_docked_bike_ride_length_hr,
    SUM(CASE WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike' THEN ride_length_min ELSE 0 END) / 60 as total_classic_bike_ride_length_hr
FROM bike_ride_clean
WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL AND end_station_name IS NOT NULL -- Exclude rows with null values
GROUP BY member_casual;
```



<img src="https://imgur.com/kp5wN74.png" width= "1000px">

Based on the statistical summery, members totaled 2,465,636 rides compared to casual with 1,652,826 total rides in the last 12 months from November 2021 to October 2022. In contrast, casual riders have a longer ride lengths than member riders.

Cyclistic bike use is popular during the summer months and decreases during fall and winter months for both casual and annual members. Casual members use Cyclistic bikes predominantly during the summer months, peaking during the last week of May from 11:00:00 to 16:00:00. Compared to casual riders, member riders has a relatively steady amount of rider usage throughout the summer months from May through August.

Member riders use Cyclistic bike more than casual riders. Inversely casual rider's ride length is higher then member riders. This may be due to causal riders using Cyclistic bike for leisurely activity for longer period of time compared to members using the service for short commutes or running errands. Ride length is longer for the classic bike followed by electric and docked bikes with casual riders . Members riders do not use dock bikes at all and prefer classic bike or electric bikes.

Casual riders out number member riders around the city center area due to the high tourist attraction and parks, reflecting bike 
use for leisurely activity. In contrast,  member riders' usage data reflect the act of commuting for work or business 
activity. The second popular area for Cyclistic bike use is north of the Loop around Wrigley Field.

# 6. Conclusion

How could your team and business apply your insights?

• Any promotions should be done on Saturday during peak hours of 1200 to 1600 hr. Specifically summer months late May through August to maximize the promotional message to casual bike share riders.

What next steps would you or your stakeholders take based on your ﬁndings?

Promotional campaign focused on casual riders. Communicate to casual riders that there could be incentives to becoming from member rider. • 1 month free or discounted price for 12 months subscription * Communicate to casual member who reach a ride length thrush hold that it may be beneficial economically to convert to annual



In summary, Cyclistic's data demonstrates that casual riders predominantly use bikes for leisure, especially on summer weekends, while annual members' usage suggests regular commuting, peaking midweek. Marketing strategies should thus target casual riders with summer promotions and consider membership incentives based on ride length. For annual members, ensuring bike availability during peak commuting times is crucial. One thing to note, although the analysis provides actionable insights, the absence of cost data presents a limitation and an opportunity for deeper understanding to refine promotional strategies further.
